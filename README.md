# WASM <-> JS type conversion exploration


I had difficulties while starting on WASM to understand:
- how JS <> WASM type conversions worked in function signatures,
- how to compile a pure library with no main
- how to use arrays

The question was repeated quite a lot on stackoverflow, so I leave this project for notes and documentation, hoping it may help another day.
